This is my first game, made in C++. It's a simple text-based RPG structured as a tournament of medieval warriors This is how fights work: Each weapon has its damage value, and when a warrior attacks a random value is added to the current weapon's damage. The random value is generated in a range, whose extremes are different for each class. Here's a list with the values. - Cavaliere ("knight"): [-10; 15] - Spadaccino ("Swordsman"): [-5; 10] - Fante ("Foot soldier"): [0; 7] - Combattente pesante ("Heavy fighter"): [-20, 0] - Lanciere ("Lancer"): [-5, 15] - Alabardiere ("Halberder"): [-15 ; 7] - Mercenario ("Mercenary"): [10; 25]
