# The Great Tournament
This is my first game, made in C++ mostly by using OOP. 
It's a simple text-based RPG structured as a tournament between medieval-like warriors.
# How fights work. 
  Each weapon has its damage value, and when a warrior attacks a random value is added to the current weapon's damage. 
  The random value is generated in a range, whose extremes are different for each class. They can be viewed in runtime.
  The game runs on Windows.
